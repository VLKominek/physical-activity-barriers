# Fitness for All: Identifying and Overcoming the Barriers to Regular Exercise in the U.S.

**Author:** Victoria Lance

## Purpose
This repository explores the multifaceted barriers preventing sedentary adults in the United States from accessing the life-changing benefits of regualr physical activity. Such benefits include improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mental wellness, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and increased social interaction, all of which contribute to a higher quality of life. A significant portion of the U.S. population remains inactive leading to rising rates of obesity and associated health complications. This project leverages data from the CDC, the Behavioral Risk Factor Durveillance System (BRFSS), and the U.S. Census to examine the economic, geographic, and social factoris that hinder access to physical activity. This research seeks to provide insights and speark discussions that can encourage a more active, healthier population.

- Cost
- Legislation


## Challenges & Lessons Learned:
**Confounding Variables:**  Economic, social, and environmental factors may interact in a complex way making it difficult to truly isolate the impact of specific barriers.  

**Inconsistent Reporting:** There might not be consistent reporting across the United States by region. There may also be inconsistent data due to self-reported activity leading to biased findings.

**Representativeness and bias:**  Many datasets have limited representation of marginalized or hard to access populations. Data at a state level may not capture localized barriers. Acknowledging and addressing these biases is crucial for an objective analysis.

These factors dhape data interpretation, necessitating a careful and objective analysis.
