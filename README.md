# Fitness for All: Identifying Factors Affecting Regular Exercise in the U.S.

**Author:** Victoria Lance

## Purpose
This repository explores the multifaceted barriers preventing sedentary adults in the United States from accessing the life-changing benefits of regular physical activity. Such benefits include improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mental wellness, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and increased social interaction, all of which contribute to a higher quality of life. A significant portion of the U.S. population remains inactive leading to rising rates of obesity and associated health complications. This project leverages data from the CDC and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to examine the economic, geographic, and social factors that hinder access to physical activity. This research seeks to provide insights and spark discussions that can encourage a more active, healthier population. 


## Focus Areas
- Geographic analysis of physical activity rates, obesity trends, exercise participation, and aerobic activity by region.
- Demographic insights into income and employment trends across states.
- Examination of costs associated with accessing physical activity.
- Review of legislation addressing obesity, nutrition, and physical activity.


## Challenges & Lessons Learned:
**Confounding Variables:** Economic, social, and environmental factors may interact in a complex way making it difficult to truly isolate the impact of specific barriers. For example, the interplay between income, access to recreational spaces, and cultural norms can obscure causal relationships.

**Inconsistent Reporting:** There might not be consistent reporting across the United States by region. There may also be inconsistent data due to self-reported activity leading to biased findings.

**Representativeness and Bias:** Many datasets lack adequate representation of marginalized or hard-to-reach populations, such as those living in rural areas or within underserved communities. Additionally, aggregated state-level data may obscure localized barriers, such as urban-rural disparities or community-specific challenges. Acknowledging and addressing these biases is crucial for an objective analysis.

**Data Gaps:** There is limited availability of standardized data on some key factors, such as the true costs associated with fitness activities or the effectiveness of legislative measures in improving physical activity rates.

These challenges underscore the importance of critical evaluation, thoughtful methodology, and transparency in data interpretation to ensure the findings provide meaningful and actionable insights.
